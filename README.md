# Healthcare_Chatbot_Using_AI
— The rise of medical chatbot development offers a promising avenue to tackle the challenges tied to timeconsuming hospital visits and the urgent demand for immediate medical guidance. This study focuses on the deployment and assessment of a web-based medical chatbot that leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to anticipate illnesses through user-input symptoms. The core mission of this endeavor is to enhance user convenience and cost-effectiveness by delivering efficient and precise healthcare recommendations from a distance. The proposed framework seamlessly integrates live chat and automated chatbot functionalities into a unified web application, ensuring user-friendliness and seamless accessibility. To attain accurate disease predictions, we trained two distinct machine learning models—Decision Tree and Naive Bayes—employing a comprehensive dataset encompassing medical insights and symptoms. The outcomes underscore the efficacy of the NLP-centered methodology in disease prediction, highlighting its potential to furnish significant healthcare assistance to users.
